          Print the Elements of a Linked List

          - Summary: The code utilizes a singly linked list data structure to store integer values.  The `main` function first takes input from the user to determine the number of nodes and their respective data. These nodes are then inserted into the linked list using the `insert_node` function. Finally, the `printLinkedList` function iterates through the list and prints the data of each node to the console.

          - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because `printLinkedList` iterates through each node once to print its data.
          - Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space used is proportional to the number of nodes stored in the linked list.
