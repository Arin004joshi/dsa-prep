          Array Reversal

          - Summary: The code uses vectors (dynamic arrays) to store and manipulate integer data.  It first reads an array of integers from standard input, then reverses the array using the STL `reverse` function. Finally, it writes the reversed array to standard output.  Helper functions handle input string trimming and splitting.

          - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the `reverse` function, and the input/output loops all iterate linearly through the array once.
          - Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is due to the space used by the input array and the reversed array. The helper functions have minimal space overhead.
