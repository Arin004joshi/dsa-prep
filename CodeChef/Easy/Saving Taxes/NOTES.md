          - Summary: The code takes an integer T as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two long long integers, X and Y, and then outputs the difference between X and Y (X - Y). No data structures beyond built-in types are used. The code reads input, performs a simple arithmetic operation, and prints the result for each test case.

          - Time Complexity: O(T), where T is the number of test cases.  The time complexity is linear because the code iterates through each test case once, performing a constant amount of work for each case.
          - Space Complexity: O(1). The space used is constant because the code only stores a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size. The input values themselves are not stored in any sizable data structure.
