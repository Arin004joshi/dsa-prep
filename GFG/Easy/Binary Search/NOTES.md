          Binary Search

          - Summary: This code implements a binary search algorithm using a vector (dynamic array). It initializes left and right pointers to the start and end of the sorted vector, respectively.  The algorithm iteratively narrows the search space by comparing the middle element with the target value (k), adjusting the left or right pointer accordingly.  It returns the index of the target value if found; otherwise, it returns -1.

          - Time Complexity: O(log n) because the search space is halved in each iteration of the while loop.
          - Space Complexity: O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
