Given two strings s1 and s2. Return true if the string s2 can be obtained by rotating (in any direction) string s1 by exactly 2 places, otherwise, false.

Note: Both rotations should be performed in same direction chosen initially.

Examples:

Input: s1 = "amazon", s2 = "azonam"
Output: true
Explanation: "amazon" can be rotated anti-clockwise by two places, which will make it as "azonam".

Input: s1 = "geeksforgeeks", s2 = "geeksgeeksfor"
Output: false
Explanation: If we rotate "geeksforgeeks" by two place in any direction, we won't get "geeksgeeksfor".

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "ab"
Output: true
Explanation: If we rotate "ab" by two place in any direction, we always get "ab".

Constraints:
1 ≤ s1.length, s2.length ≤ 105
