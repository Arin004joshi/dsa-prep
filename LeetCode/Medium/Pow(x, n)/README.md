50. Pow(x, n)SolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesImplement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

Â 
Example 1:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000


Example 2:

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100


Example 3:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25


Â 
Constraints:


	-100.0 < x < 100.0
	-231 <= n <= 231-1
	n is an integer.
	Either x is not zero or n > 0.
	-104 <= xn <= 104

What even is the point of this edge case???Â Read more18825olooneyJul 06, 2018This is the 37th problem I've solved on the site and in the end I got a respectible 4ms solution. But honestly, It seems like its 2% algorithm, 98% fiddling with binary representations of signed integers and floating point numbers. I also note that, as of this writing, the problem has 1160 downvotes to 428 upvotes, so there's certainly some shared negativity out there.
Personally, I didn't enjoy this problem because I felt like I spent more time writing custom test cases for corner cases than I did programming. Frankly I cannot imagine getting this question in an interview and having the interviewer go, "aha! but your solution doesn't account for the case when n is -2^31 and x is exactly -1.0! There's no way we'd hire such an incompetent programmer!" And yet the way the acceptance tests are written, you need to nail every single corner case. Perhaps that frustration is limited to C/C++? Or there's a different algorithm that more naturally accounts for these edge cases?
What was your experience? Would you agree or disagree with my thesis that this is the worst problem on the site?Â Read more27411Rishabh MishraJul 24, 2023Someone just hates society
