          - Title: Pow(x, n)
          - Diffiiculty: Medium

          - Summary: This Java code calculates x raised to the power of n using the built-in Math.pow() function.  No custom data structures are used; the function directly utilizes the Math library's pow method, which internally handles the exponentiation calculation. The function takes a double x and an integer n as input and returns the result of x raised to the power of n as a double.

          - Time Complexity: O(1) - The Math.pow() function in Java typically uses optimized algorithms (often involving logarithms) to compute the power, resulting in a constant time complexity irrespective of the input size.
          - Space Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input values of x and n.
