          - Pow(x, n)
          - Medium

          - Summary: This Java code calculates x raised to the power of n using the built-in Math.pow() function.  No explicit data structures are used; the function directly leverages the Math library's functionality. The execution flow involves a single line: the function receives inputs x and n, and immediately returns the result of Math.pow(x, n).

          - Time Complexity: O(1) - The Math.pow() function in Java typically uses optimized algorithms (likely involving logarithms) which operate in effectively constant time, irrespective of the input values.
          - Space Complexity: O(1) - The function uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input values. No additional data structures are allocated.
