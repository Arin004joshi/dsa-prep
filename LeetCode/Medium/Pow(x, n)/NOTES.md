          Pow(x, n)

          - Diffiiculty: Medium

          - Summary: The code utilizes the built-in Math.pow() function to compute x raised to the power of n.  No explicit data structures are used; the function directly leverages the functionality provided by the Java Math library.  The execution flow involves a single line: the function call to Math.pow(x,n) which calculates and returns the result. The function doesn't involve any loops or iterative steps.

          - Time Complexity: O(1) - The Math.pow() function in Java typically uses optimized algorithms (possibly involving logarithms and bit manipulation) with constant time complexity in practice, regardless of the input values.
          - Space Complexity: O(1) - The function uses a constant amount of space, independent of the input size. It does not create any dynamically sized data structures.
