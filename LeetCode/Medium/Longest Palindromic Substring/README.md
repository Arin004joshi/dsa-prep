5. Longest Palindromic SubstringSolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesHintGiven a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.


Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"


 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s consist of only digits and English letters.

Similarly is “xabay” a palindrome?Hint 3Complexity based hint:
If we use brute-force and check whether for every start and end position a substring is a palindrome we have O(n^2) start - end pairs and O(n) palindromic checks. Can we reduce the time for palindromic checks to O(1) by reusing some previous computation.Similar QuestionsShortest PalindromeHardPalindrome PermutationEasyPalindrome PairsHardLongest Palindromic SubsequenceMediumPalindromic SubstringsMediumMaximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome SubstringsHardDiscussion (496)Choose a typeComment💡 Discussion Rules1.

It's almost the rule to find the exact opposite for the discussion of every question.

A common mistake:
Some people will be tempted to come up with a quick solution, which is unfortunately flawed (however can be corrected easily):
Reverse S and become S’. Find the longest common substring between S and S’, which must also be the longest palindromic substring.
This seemed to work, let’s see some examples below.
For example,
S = “caba”, S’ = “abac”.
The longest common substring between S and S’ is “aba”, which is the answer.
Let’s try another example:
S = “abacdfgdcaba”, S’ = “abacdgfdcaba”.
The longest common substring between S and S’ is “abacd”. Clearly, this is not a valid palindrome.
We could see that the longest common substring method fails when there exists a reversed copy of a non-palindromic substring in some other part of S. To rectify this, each time we find a longest common substring candidate, we check if the substring’s indices are the same as the reversed substring’s original indices. If it is, then we attempt to update the longest palindrome found so far; if not, we skip this and find the next candidate.
Is this part correct?
example string: abcxycba
reverse string:  abcxycba
The substring indices are same as reversed string original indices and yet it is not a palindrome? Read more949napoleonNov 08, 2013My Solution Is Naive, It Cost O(n^2), Is there Any Solution faster? Read more10313Tomas SandvenApr 25, 2023I'm getting "Time Limit Exceeded" with 141/141 testcases passed and "Last Executed Input" is:

So I copied and pasted the TC into a custom test case, and started to think about what I could tweak. However, I ended up accidentally hitting Run Code, but instead of getting a Time Limit Exceeded result, it passed:

Is this supposed to happen and I just need to make my code more efficient, or is this a bug?

Even if you write a classical DP or memorization solution for this one you will timeout on latest tests.
I think they consider it edge cases. Because if you add one simple line it will pass! OMG.
I have leet code for this. Instead of solving problems I spend hours optimizing the constants.
