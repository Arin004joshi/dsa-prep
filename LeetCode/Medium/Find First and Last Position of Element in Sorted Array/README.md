34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted ArraySolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesGiven an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You mustÂ write an algorithm withÂ O(log n) runtime complexity.

Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Example 3:
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]

Â 
Constraints:


	0 <= nums.length <= 105
	-109Â <= nums[i]Â <= 109
	nums is a non-decreasing array.
	-109Â <= targetÂ <= 109
