242. Valid AnagramSolvedEasyTopicsCompaniesGiven two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Â 
Example 1:


Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true


Example 2:


Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

Output: false


Â 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
	s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

i wonder whether it's math trick or it's simply a his hash function ?
i guess it's a hash function with big probability to ensure no collision so far.
