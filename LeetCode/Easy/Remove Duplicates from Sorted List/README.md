83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted ListSolvedEasyTopicsCompaniesGiven the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Â 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]


Â 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
	The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

I'm new to python programming. It'd be very helpful if someone can explain why do we use Optional?

def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

**Here, why do we use Optional[ListNode]? How is it useful? **Â Read more257AaryanSep 10, 2023Simple Approach
In this approach we will only use single pointer and iterate over the list while checking for duplicate nodes and deleting them simultanously also.


Initialize a pointer to head, here I used 'temp' and iterate it over the linked list.


In each each iteration check if data of next node of temp and data of current node of temp are equal or not , if both data are equal then we have a duplicate value , so update the next node of 'temp' to temp->next->next;


While we update the next value of temp if duplicate value is found we also need to delete the node where duplicate value exist, NOTE:- It will be better practice if you store the node to be deleted in another variable and then delete this variable instead of directly deleting the node to be delected bcoz it may lead to errors.


But if the next value of temp is not equal to temp i.e no duplicate value then move the temp to next position , repeat this process and when the loop terminates you will get your list without duplicate values.

Can anyone explain
var current = head;
while (current.next != null) {
if (current.next.val == current.val) {
current.next = current.next.next;
}
else {
current = current.next;
}
}
Is it because its reference type?Â Read moreAsk Question106NicaishishaDec 29, 2013In an interview, will that matter if we forget to delete the duplicate nodes?
